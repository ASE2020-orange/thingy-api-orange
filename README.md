## Run

You need to have docker installed on your machine.
Then using the a bash interpreter go to the ./server folder.

Run the following scripts, in order : 
- `./build_container.sh` and wait for the container to build
- `./run_container.sh`

Then you can open your browser on `localhost:1080` and check if you get a response from the server.
